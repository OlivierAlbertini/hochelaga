## Considerations & to-do's

* Regions vertical padding : should there be a default top padding? Added with a .padding-v class?
* Mobile layout with the bs row wrapper for form elements no longer works, think of a custom solution, I guess
* Perceptual elements width : shaded items are narrower than their text counterpart
