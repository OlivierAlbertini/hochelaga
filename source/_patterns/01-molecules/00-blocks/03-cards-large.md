A more complex card unit, with icon position that varies according to the breakpoint.

Add class <code>.card-large</code> to <code>.card</code>

Add an optionnal <code>.card-row-layout</code> for icon placement to the right or left at larger breakpoint.

Large cards should be used in a 1 or 2 columns bootstrap grid layout.
